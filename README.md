#Title 
WASSERSTOFF-Front-end-Developer-Task

I developed this admin dashboard using react js and ant design , react icon libraries.

#Techonolgy Stack
React , Datajson,Html ,Css ,Javascript, Git, Github, Netlify , Ant design libraries for layout, icon , Ant visual libraries for barchart, histogram , react icons for icons ,react router dom to navigate from one page to other pages.

#Steps
Simply download the code in your system and open the vs code or other editor after that add dependency like ant design {npm install antd} ,{npm install react-icons} , {npm i react-router-dom} after that {npm start}

for deploy project on website for other people can see your website simply run the command {npm run build} in your terminal or a build will create in your project folder file simply drag and drop the build folder to netlify like free hosted website.

#Explaination about project :
So,First, it would be important to define the specific requirements and goals of the dashboard, such as the types of data to be analyzed, the target audience, and the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be tracked. This would help to guide the selection of appropriate data visualization tools and components from the Ant Design library. Next, it would be important to design the overall layout and structure of the dashboard, including the placement and sizing of various charts and tables, as well as any interactive features such as dropdown menus or filters. This could be accomplished using Ant Design's layout and grid system, along with custom CSS styles as needed. Once the basic layout has been established, it would be important to integrate the data visualization components and connect them to the appropriate data sources. This could involve using React.js components to fetch and manipulate data from a backend API or database, and then passing that data to the appropriate Ant Design chart or table components for display. Finally, it would be important to test and refine the dashboard to ensure that it meets the desired functionality and performance requirements, as well as the overall design aesthetic. This could involve iterating on the layout and data visualization components, as well as optimizing the code for performance and scalability.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
