Title : WASSERSTOFF-Front-end-Developer-Task



I developed this admin dashboard using react js and ant design , react icon libraries.



Techonolgy Stack: React , Datajson,Html ,Css ,Javascript, Git, Github, Netlify , Ant design libraries for layout, icon , Ant visual libraries for barchart, histogram , react icons for icons ,react router dom to navigate from one page to other pages.

Steps: Simply download the code in your system and open the vs code or other editor after that  add dependency like ant design {npm install antd} ,{npm install react-icons} , {npm i react-router-dom} after that {npm start}

for deploy project on website for other people can see your website simply run the command {npm run build} in your terminal or a build will create in your project folder file simply drag and drop the build folder to netlify like free hosted website.

Explaination about project : So,First, it would be important to define the specific requirements and goals of the dashboard, such as the types of data to be analyzed, the target audience, and the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be tracked. This would help to guide the selection of appropriate data visualization tools and components from the Ant Design library.
Next, it would be important to design the overall layout and structure of the dashboard, including the placement and sizing of various charts and tables, as well as any interactive features such as dropdown menus or filters. This could be accomplished using Ant Design's layout and grid system, along with custom CSS styles as needed.
Once the basic layout has been established, it would be important to integrate the data visualization components and connect them to the appropriate data sources. This could involve using React.js components to fetch and manipulate data from a backend API or database, and then passing that data to the appropriate Ant Design chart or table components for display.
Finally, it would be important to test and refine the dashboard to ensure that it meets the desired functionality and performance requirements, as well as the overall design aesthetic. This could involve iterating on the layout and data visualization components, as well as optimizing the code for performance and scalability.
